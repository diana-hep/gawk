Various ideas for a particle physics domain specific language.

   * **reinterpreted-python:** We don't need to create a syntax; we can decorate Python functions and reinterpret them as our language.
   * **refinement-types:** The type-checking pass can verify constraints such as attempts to select the first or maximum element of a possibly empty list.
   * **pattern-match:** Using 2-D syntax and pattern matching to fit particle candidates into complex decay chains.
